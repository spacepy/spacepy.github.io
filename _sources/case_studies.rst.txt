SpacePy Case Studies
********************

The SpacePy team has prepared case studies showing how to reproduce
the results from published papers using Python-based tools, including
SpacePy. It is hoped that these extensively-documented examples will
ease the transition to Python for space scientists.

Basic familiarity with programming and general computing tasks in your
chosen environment is assumed, including editing text files, copying
and deleting files, etc. No Python-specific knowledge is assumed,
although it is recommended to at least skim the excellent `Python
tutorial <http://docs.python.org/tutorial/index.html>`_.
